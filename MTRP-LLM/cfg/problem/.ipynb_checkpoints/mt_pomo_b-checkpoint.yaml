  I need assistance in designing a new heuristic to improve the solution of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) by incorporating insights from prior heuristics. The VRPTW requires finding a set of optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve all given customers and return to the depot. The objective is to minimize the total travel distance or time while adhering to both capacity and time window constraints.
