The heuristics function computes heuristic indicators to guide edge selection in a Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacitated.
Inputs

current_distance_matrix: Tensor (pomo_size, N+1), distance from the current node to all other nodes.

delivery_node_demands: Tensor (N+1), delivery demand at each node. Used to check if the vehicle has sufficient remaining load to deliver.

current_load: Tensor (pomo_size), remaining capacity of the vehicle at each trajectory.

Outputs

Returns a heuristic score matrix of shape (pomo_size, N+1), assigning positive scores to promising edges and negative scores to infeasible ones.

Implementation Requirements

Fully vectorized implementation optimized for GPU execution.
Efficient batch evaluation under the POMO framework.
Introduce controlled randomness in scoring to avoid premature convergence to local optima.
