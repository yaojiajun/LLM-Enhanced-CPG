1. Implement adaptive scaling for randomness based on constraint severity to guide exploration effectively.
2. Develop dynamic scoring mechanisms incorporating historical performance data to refine edge selections.
3. Use hybrid approaches combining determinism and randomness to maintain balance between exploration and exploitation while respecting all constraints.
