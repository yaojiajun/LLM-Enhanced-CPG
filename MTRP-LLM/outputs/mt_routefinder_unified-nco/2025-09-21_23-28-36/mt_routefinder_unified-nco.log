[2025-09-21 23:28:38,873][root][INFO] - Problem description: I need assistance in designing a new heuristic to improve the solution of the Unified Vehicle Routing Problem (Unified VRP) by incorporating insights from prior heuristics. The Unified VRP requires finding a set of optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve all given customers, potentially without returning to the depot (open routes). This problem incorporates multiple constraints: firstly, capacity limits where each customer has a demand (including backhauls for pickups and deliveries), and the total cannot exceed vehicle capacity; secondly, time windows where each customer must be visited within a specific interval defined by an earliest and latest possible service time; and thirdly, duration limits ensuring the total route length or time does not exceed preset thresholds. The heuristics function computes heuristic indicators to guide edge selection in a Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacitated, Time Windows, Backhauls, open routes and duration limits. The objective is to minimize the total travel distance or time while adhering to all capacity, time window, backhaul, open route, and duration constraints.

User Prompt: 
Write a heuristics function for I need assistance in designing a new heuristic to improve the solution of the Unified Vehicle Routing Problem (Unified VRP) by incorporating insights from prior heuristics. The Unified VRP requires finding a set of optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve all given customers, potentially without returning to the depot (open routes).

The objective is to minimize the total travel distance or time while adhering to all capacity, time window, backhaul, open route, and duration constraints.

The heuristics function computes heuristic indicators to guide edge selection in a Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacitated, Time Windows, Backhauls, open routes and duration limits.

Inputs

current_distance_matrix: Tensor (pomo_size, N+1), distance from the current node to all other nodes.

delivery_node_demands: Tensor (N+1), delivery demand at each node. Used to check if the vehicle has sufficient remaining load to deliver.

current_load: Tensor (pomo_size), remaining capacity of the vehicle at each trajectory.

delivery_node_demands_open: Tensor (N+1), delivery demand at each node for open-route feasibility checks.

current_load_open: Tensor (pomo_size), remaining load capacity for open routes.

time_windows: Tensor (N+1, 2), earliest and latest service times for each node.

arrival_times: Tensor (pomo_size, N+1), estimated arrival times at the next node.

pickup_node_demands: Tensor (N+1), pickup demand at each node.

current_length: Tensor (pomo_size), remaining route duration budget at each trajectory.

Outputs

Returns a heuristic score matrix of shape (pomo_size, N+1), assigning positive scores to promising edges and negative scores to infeasible ones.

Implementation Requirements

Fully vectorized implementation optimized for GPU execution.

Efficient batch evaluation under the POMO framework.

Introduce controlled randomness in scoring to avoid premature convergence to local optima.

Ensure outputs contain only finite values (no nan, inf, or -inf).

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `heuristics_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.



[Specific Modification Task]
Based on the seed code above, generate a modified version of the heuristics function. You must ONLY change the calculations related to 'current_distance_matrix', 'delivery_node_demands', and 'current_load' (e.g., how distance_heuristic, delivery_score, or pickup_score is computed or how they are integrated into the total score, where these inputs are involved). Do NOT change any calculations or logic related to other inputs like delivery_node_demands_open, current_load_open, time_windows, arrival_times, pickup_node_demands, or current_length. Keep the function signature, structure, variable names, and all other parts identical. Ensure the output remains a heuristic score matrix of shape (pomo_size, N+1) with positive scores for promising edges and negative for undesirable ones.
