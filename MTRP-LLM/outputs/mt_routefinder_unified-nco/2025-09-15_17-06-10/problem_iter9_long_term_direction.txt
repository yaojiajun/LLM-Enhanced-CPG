1. Experiment with hybrid nonlinear transformations that combine multiple functions for richer score evaluation.
2. Implement dynamic weighting influenced by customer proximity or demand to enhance adaptability.
3. Prioritize essential components in scoring to maintain simplicity while maximizing exploration.
4. Use ensemble heuristics to leverage diverse strategies for improved solution robustness.
