1. Implement adaptive weights that dynamically respond to constraint satisfaction levels for better balance.  
2. Enhance randomness by allowing greater exploration near critical constraints.  
3. Use real-time feedback to fine-tune distance, demand, and time scores for context-specific evaluations.  
4. Focus on interactions between pickups, deliveries, and time windows for optimized routes.
