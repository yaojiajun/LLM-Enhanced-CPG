1. Enhance adaptability by integrating real-time feedback loops to dynamically adjust scoring weights based on operational performance.
2. Implement non-linear functions for distance and demand to capture complex relationships and improve flexibility.
3. Use clustering techniques for demand to improve exploration strategies in solution space.
