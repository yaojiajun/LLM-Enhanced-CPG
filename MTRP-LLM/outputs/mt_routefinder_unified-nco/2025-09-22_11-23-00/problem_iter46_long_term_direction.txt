1. Refine scoring formulas by integrating non-linear relationships to better capture interactions between pickup demands and route lengths.

2. Employ adaptive dynamic weights and explore different noise levels to enhance robustness and prevent premature convergence.

3. Test varying exponent values and clamp ranges systematically for improved balance between exploration and exploitation.
