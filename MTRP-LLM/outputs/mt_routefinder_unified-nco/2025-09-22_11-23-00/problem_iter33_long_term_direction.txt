1. Implement hybrid scoring mechanisms combining time, distance, and demand to capture nuanced interactions.
2. Utilize adaptive weighting for penalties and rewards based on real-time constraint status.
3. Enable stochastic elements that dynamically adjust exploration near critical thresholds.
4. Integrate multi-objective optimization to balance trade-offs effectively.
