1. Integrate adaptive noise to heuristic indicators for dynamic response for constraints.
2. Prioritize problem-specific factorsâ€™ interactions to enhance routing.
3. Employ diverse heuristic strategies selectively, promoting exploration in solution space.
4. Utilize penalty adjustments for time windows and capacity limits.
5. Continuously refine weights to balance exploration-exploitation effectively.
